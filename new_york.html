        <h2>ABOUT:</h2>
        <P>New York, often called New York City (NYC), is the most populous city in the United States, located at the southern tip of <BR/>
            New York State on one of the world's largest natural harbors. The city comprises five boroughs, each coextensive with a <BR/>
            respective county. The city is the geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York <BR/>
            metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the United States by both population and urban area. New York is a <BR/>
            global center of finance and commerce, culture, technology, entertainment and media, academics, and scientific output, <BR/>
            the arts and fashion, and, as home to the headquarters of the United Nations, international diplomacy. </P>
        <p>New York City traces its origins to Fort Amsterdam and a trading post founded on Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists around 1624. <br/>
            The settlement was named New Amsterdam in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653. The city came under English control in 1664<br/>
            and was temporarily renamed New York after King Charles II granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York, before being <br/>
            permanently renamed New York in November 1674. Following independence from Great Britain, the city was the national capital <br/>
            of the United States from 1785 until 1790. The modern city was formed by the 1898 consolidation of its five boroughs: Manhattan,<br/>
            Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island.</p>
        <p>Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District, Manhattan, New York City has been called both the world's premier financial and fintech<br/> 
            center and the most economically powerful city in the world. As of 2022, the New York metropolitan area is the largest metropolitan economy <br/>
            in the world, with a gross metropolitan product of over US$2.16 trillion. The New York metropolitan area's economy is larger than all but <br/>
            nine countries in the world. Despite having a 24/7 rapid transit system, New York also leads the world in urban automobile traffic congestion.<br/>
            The city is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by market capitalization of their listed companies: the New York Stock Exchange <br/>
            and Nasdaq. New York City is an established safe haven for global investors. As of 2023, New York City is the most expensive city in the <br/>
            world for expatriates and has by a wide margin the highest residential rents of any city in the nation. Fifth Avenue is the most expensive<br/>
            shopping street in the world. New York City is home to the highest number of billionaires,  individuals of ultra-high net worth <br/>
            (greater than US$30 million), and millionaires of any city in the world by a significant margin. </p>
