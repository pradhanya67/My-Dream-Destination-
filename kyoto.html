        <h2>ABOUT:</h2>
        <P>Kyoto is one of the oldest municipalities in Japan, having been chosen in 794 as the new seat of Japan's imperial court by Emperor Kanmu.<br/> 
            The original city, named Heian-kyō, was arranged in accordance with traditional Chinese feng shui following the model of the ancient <br/>
            Chinese capitals of Chang'an and Luoyang. The emperors of Japan ruled from Kyoto in the following eleven centuries until 1869. <br/>
            It was the scene of several key events of the Muromachi period, Sengoku period, and the Boshin War, such as the Ōnin War, the Honnō-ji Incident,<br/>
            the Kinmon incident, and the Battle of Toba–Fushimi. The capital was relocated from Kyoto to Tokyo after the Meiji Restoration. <br/>
            The modern municipality of Kyoto was established in 1889. The city was spared from large-scale destruction during World War II and, <br/>
            as a result, its prewar cultural heritage has mostly been preserved.</P>
        <P>Kyoto is considered the cultural capital of Japan and is a major tourist destination. The agency for cultural affairs of the national <br/>
           government is headquartered in the city. It is home to numerous Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, palaces and gardens, some of which <br/>
           have been designated collectively as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Prominent landmarks include the Kyoto Imperial Palace, <br/>
           Kiyomizu-dera, Kinkaku-ji, Ginkaku-ji, and Kyoto Tower. The internationally renowned video game company Nintendo is based in Kyoto.<br/>
           Kyoto is also a center of higher learning in the country, and its institutions include Kyoto University, the second-oldest <br/>
           university in Japan.</P>
