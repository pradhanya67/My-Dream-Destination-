    <h2>ABOUT:</h2>
    <P>PETRA, JODAN:
    originally known to its inhabitants as is an ancient city and archaeological<BR/>
    site in southern Jordan. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water <BR/>
    conduit systems, Petra is also called the "Rose City" because of the colour <BR/>
    of the sandstone from which it is carved.The city is one of the New 7 Wonders <BR/>
    of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. <BR/>
    The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and was settled by<BR/> 
    the Nabataeans, a nomadic Arab people, in the 4th century BC. Petra would later become<BR/>
     the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom in the second century BC. The Nabataeans <BR/>
     invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major <BR/>
     regional trading hub, which gained them considerable revenue. Unlike their enemies, <BR/>
     the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts and thus were able to <BR/>
     defend their kingdom. They were particularly skillful in agriculture, stone carving, <BR/>
     and rainwater harvesting.<BR/>
    Petra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure, possibly the <BR/>
    mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV, was constructed, and its population peaked at <BR/>
    an estimated 20,000 inhabitants. Nabataea fell to the Romans in 106 AD, who annexed <BR/>
    and renamed it Arabia Petraea. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, <BR/>
    and after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era, several<BR/> 
    Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline and, by the early <BR/>
    Islamic era, it wasabandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown to the <BR/>
    western world until 1812, when Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered it.<BR/>
    UNESCO has described Petra as "one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural<BR/> 
    heritage". Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. <BR/>
    Visitor numbers reach close to a million tourists every year. <BR/>

 <h2>FAMOUS FOOD IN JODAN:</h2>
 <P>Jordanian cuisine is a Levantine cuisine developed over time in Jordan. Stuffed vegetables are common,<BR/>
     with many different techniques employed in their preparation. Meat is an important component of <BR/>
     Jordanian cuisine, most often lamb, beef and chicken but also goat and camel meat. Rice is frequently<BR/> 
     served as a side dish but there are also one-pot rice dishes such as maqloubah. <BR/></P>
<P>As one of the largest producers of olives in the world, olive oil is the main cooking oil by Jordanians<BR/> 
    and Jordan as a whole. Herbs, garlic, onion, tomato sauce, and lemon are typical flavors found in Jordan.<BR/></P>
<P>The blend of spices called za'atar contains a common local herb called sumac that grows wild in Jordan and <BR/>
    is closely identified with Jordanian and other Middle Eastern countries.<BR/></P>
<P>Yogurt is commonly served alongside food and is a common ingredient itself; in particular, jameed,<BR/> 
    a form of dried yogurt is unique to Jordanian cuisine and a main ingredient in mansaf the national <BR/>
    dish of Jordan, and a symbol in Jordanian culture for generosity.<BR/></P>
<P>Another famous meat dish in Jordan is zarb. It is especially popular in areas inhabited by Bedouin<BR/> 
    tribes such as Petra and the desert of Wadi Rum where it is commonly served to tourists. Zarb is <BR/>
    prepared in a submerged oven called a taboon, and is considered a delicacy. It consists of a <BR/>
    selection of meat (usually chicken and lamb), vegetables (zucchini, eggplant, carrots, potatoes) <BR/>
    and is served with rice and various meze, such as tabbouleh salad.<BR/> </P>
<P>Internationally known foods which are common and popular everyday snacks in Jordan include hummus,<BR/> 
    which is a pur√©e of chick peas blended with tahini, lemon, and garlic, and falafel, a deep-fried <BR/>
    ball or patty made from ground chickpeas.<BR/></P>
<P>A typical mezze includes foods such as kibbeh, labaneh, baba ghanoush, tabbouleh, olives and pickles.<BR/> 
    Bread, rice, freekeh and bulgur all have a role in Jordanian cuisine.<BR/></P>
<P>Popular desserts include baklava, knafeh, halva and qatayef (a dish made specially for Ramadan),<BR/> 
    in addition to seasonal fruits such as watermelons, figs, and cactus pear which are served in summer.<BR/> </P>
<P>Turkish coffee and tea flavored with mint or sage are almost ubiquitous in Jordan. Arabic coffee <BR/>
    is also usually served on more formal occasions. <BR/></P>
<P>Pork consumption is forbidden to Muslims in Jordan, in accordance with Sharia, the Islamic law.<BR/></P>
