        <h2>ABOUT:</h2>
        <p>Before the 17th century, Tokyo, then known as Edo, was mainly a fishing village.<br/> 
            It gained political prominence in 1603 when it became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate.<br/> 
            By the mid-18th century, Edo was among the world's largest cities, with over a million residents.<br/> 
            After the Meiji Restoration (1868), the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city <br/>
            was renamed Tokyo (lit. 'Eastern Capital'). Tokyo was greatly damaged by the 1923 Great Kantō <br/>
            earthquake and by allied bombing raids during World War II. From the late 1940s, Tokyo underwent <br/>
            rapid reconstruction and expansion, which fueled the Japanese economic miracle, in which Japan's<br/>
            economy became the second-largest in the world at the time, behind that of the United States. <br/>
            As of 2023, Tokyo is home to 29 of the world's 500 largest companies, as listed in the annual <br/>
            Fortune Global 500—the second highest number of any city. </p>
        <p>Tokyo was the first city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics and Paralympics, in 1964 and then in 2021.<br/> 
            It also hosted three G7 summits, in 1979, 1986, and 1993. Tokyo is an international hub of research and <br/>
            development and an academic center, with several major universities, including the University of Tokyo,<br/>
            the top-ranking university in Japan. Tokyo Station is the central hub for the Shinkansen, <br/>
            the country's high-speed railway network; and the city's Shinjuku Station is the world's busiest train station.<br/>
            Tokyo Skytree is the world's tallest tower. The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, which opened in 1927, is the oldest <br/>
            underground metro line in the Asia–Pacific region. </p>
