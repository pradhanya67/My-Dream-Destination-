        <h2>ABOUT:</h2>
        <P>The Maldives is the smallest Asia. It  is the capital and the most populated city, traditionally <BR/>
            called the "King's Island", where the ancient royal dynasties ruled from its central location. <BR/>
            The Maldives has been inhabited for over 2,500 years. Documented contact with the outside world <BR/>
            began around 947 AD when Arab travelers began visiting the islands. In the 12th century, partly <BR/>
            due to the importance of the Arabs and Persians as traders in the Indian Ocean, Islam reached <BR/>
            the Maldivian Archipelago.The Maldives was soon consolidated as a sultanate, developing strong <BR/>
            commercial and cultural ties with Asia and Africa. From the mid-16th century, the region came <BR/>
            under the increasing influence of European colonial powers, with the Maldives becoming a British <BR/>
            protectorate in 1887. Independence from the United Kingdom came in 1965, and a presidential <BR/>
            republic was established in 1968 with an elected People's Majlis. The ensuing decades have seen <BR/>
            political instability, efforts at democratic reform, and environmental challenges posed by climate <BR/>
            change and rising sea levels.[13] The Maldives became a founding member of the South Asian Association <BR/>
            for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
