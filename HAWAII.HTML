        <h2> ABOUT:</h2>
        <P>Hawaii consists of 137 volcanic islands that comprise almost the entire Hawaiian archipelago (the exception,<br/> 
            which is outside the state, is Midway Atoll). Spanning 1,500 miles (2,400 km), the state is physiographically <br/>
            and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania. Hawaii's ocean coastline is consequently the <br/>
            fourth-longest in the U.S., at about 750 miles (1,210 km). The eight main islands, from northwest to southeast, <br/>
            are Niʻihau, Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, Kahoʻolawe, Maui, and Hawaiʻi, after which the state is named; <br/>
            the last is often called the "Big Island" or "Hawaii Island" to avoid confusion with the state or archipelago. <br/>
            The uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands make up most of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, <br/>
            the largest protected area in the U.S. and the fourth-largest in the world.</P>
        <P>Of the 50 U.S. states, Hawaii is the fourth-smallest in land area and the 11th-least populous; but with 1.4 million residents,<br/> 
            it ranks 13th in population density. Two-thirds of Hawaii residents live on O'ahu, home to the state's capital and largest city,<br/>
             Honolulu. Hawaii is one of the most demographically diverse U.S. states, owing to its central location in the Pacific and over<br/>
            two centuries of migration. As one of only seven majority-minority states, it has the only Asian American plurality, the<br/>
            largest Buddhist community, and largest proportion of multiracial people in the U.S. Consequently, Hawaii is a unique <br/>
            melting pot of North American and East Asian cultures, in addition to its indigenous Hawaiian heritage.</P>
        <P>Settled by Polynesians sometime between 1000 and 1200 CE, Hawaii was home to numerous independent chiefdoms.] In 1778, <br/>
            British explorer James Cook was the first known non-Polynesian to arrive at the archipelago; early British influence is <br/>
            reflected in the state flag, which bears a Union Jack. An influx of European and American explorers, traders, and whalers<br/>
            soon arrived, leading to the decimation of the once-isolated indigenous community through the introduction of diseases such <br/>
            as syphilis, tuberculosis, smallpox, and measles; the native Hawaiian population declined from between 300,000 and one million <br/>
            to less than 40,000 by 1890. Hawaii became a unified, internationally recognized kingdom in 1810, remaining independent until <br/>
            American and European businessmen overthrew the monarchy in 1893; this led to annexation by the U.S. in 1898. <br/>
            As a strategically valuable U.S. territory, Hawaii was attacked by Japan on December 7, 1941, which brought it global <br/>
            and historical significance, and contributed to America's entry into World War II. Hawaii is the most recent state to join the union, <br/>
            on August 21, 1959. In 1993, the U.S. government formally apologized for its role in the overthrow of Hawaii's government, which had<br/> 
            spurred the Hawaiian sovereignty movement and has led to ongoing efforts to obtain redress for the indigenous population.</P>
        <P>Historically dominated by a plantation economy, Hawaii remains a major agricultural exporter due to its fertile soil and uniquely<br/>
            tropical climate in the U.S. Its economy has gradually diversified since the mid-20th century, with tourism and military defense <br/>
            becoming the two largest sectors. The state attracts visitors, surfers, and scientists with its diverse natural scenery, <br/>
            warm tropical climate, abundant public beaches, oceanic surroundings, active volcanoes, and clear skies on the Big Island. <br/>
            Hawaii hosts the United States Pacific Fleet, the world's largest naval command, as well as 75,000 employees of the Defense Department.<br/> 
            Hawaii's isolation results in one of the highest costs of living in the U.S. However, Hawaii is the third-wealthiest state, and residents <br/>
            have the longest life expectancy of any U.S. state, at 80.7 years. </P>
