    <h2>ABOUT:</h2>
    <p>
        The area that would become Cairo was part of ancient Egypt, as the Giza pyramid complex<br/> 
     and the ancient cities of Memphis and Heliopolis are near-by. Located near the Nile Delta,<br/>
     the predecessor settlement was Fustat following the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 next to <br/>
     an existing ancient Roman fortress, Babylon. Subsequently, Cairo was founded by the <br/>
     Fatimid dynasty in 969. It later superseded Fustat as the main urban centre during the Ayyubid<br/> 
     and Mamluk periods (12thâ€“16th centuries).<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Cairo has since become a longstanding centre of political and cultural life, and is titled<br/> 
        "the city of a thousand minarets" for its preponderance of Islamic architecture. Cairo's <br/>
        historic center was awarded World Heritage Site status in 1979. Cairo is considered a <br/>
        World City with a "Beta +" classification according to GaWC.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Cairo has the oldest and largest film and music industry in the Arab world, as well as <br/>
        Egypt's oldest institution of higher learning, Al-Azhar University. Many international <br/>
        media, businesses, and organizations have regional headquarters in the city;<br/> 
        the Arab League has had its headquarters in Cairo for most of its existence.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>Cairo, like many other megacities, suffers from high levels of pollution and traffic.<br/> 
        The Cairo Metro, opened in 1987, is the oldest metro system in Africa,[11] and ranks <br/>
        amongst the fifteen busiest in the world,[12] with over 1 billion[13] annual passenger <br/>
        rides. The economy of Cairo was ranked first in the Middle East in 2005,[14] and <br/>
        43rd globally on Foreign Policy's 2010 Global Cities Index.[15]<br/></p>

    <h2>FAMOUS FOOD IN CIARO</h2>

    <P>Koshari is the most famous food to try in Cairo, particularly when visiting the Great Pyramid of Giza.<BR/>
         It's a popular, affordable, and filling dish considered by many to be Egypt's national dish. <BR/>
        Koshari is a flavorful mix of rice, lentils, pasta (macaroni or spaghetti), fried onions, and<BR/> 
        various sauces (tomato, garlic, and spicy). It's widely available as street food and in restaurants,<BR/> 
        making it a perfect choice for refueling after exploring the pyramids. <BR/>
